              <p>Successful founders do three things right â€” they make a great product, hire an amazing team, and set the vision. But the best founders? They use every ounce of capital available to bet on themselves. And sometimes they win big.</p>
              <p>Our goal is to airdrop capital to founders reinventing the world. We do it by partnering with long-term capital allocators and making software that works.</p>
              <p>If your startup is growing like a weed, please consider raising your Series A on airdrop. You can reach us by email at chris@airdrop.is</p>
